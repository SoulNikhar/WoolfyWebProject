## Woolfy: Revolutionizing the Wool Industry

### Problem Statement:
The wool industry faces significant challenges due to the lack of a centralized platform. Farmers struggle to showcase their wool, companies find it difficult to procure high-quality wool, and consumers lack access to a diverse range of finished wool products.

### Solution:
Woolfy aims to revolutionize the wool industry by providing a centralized platform. Farmers can list their wool, companies can easily purchase it, and consumers can access a wide variety of finished wool products. This platform fosters transparency, efficiency, and convenience for all stakeholders in the wool supply chain.
